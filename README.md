# Opendoor

Automatically open the main entrance of your apartment complex.

Opendoor takes advantage of apartments that are equipped with locks that can be opened using a telephone call. By adding a passphrase and an allowed number, your friends can easily just message you their passphrase and this app will dial the number for opening your apartment complex main entrance.
